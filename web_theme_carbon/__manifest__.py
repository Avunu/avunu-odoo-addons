        # a backend bundle keeps the blast radius to the backend.

        # whole flattened list: by the time our commands run, the includes
        # have already spliced the anchor into it.

        # token CSS and the component rules are not variables, though, so they
        # have to be dropped explicitly.

        # every backend page. A glob that matches nothing returns [] and is a
        # safe no-op.

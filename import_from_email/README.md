# Base Import From Email

Three pieces that together let an inbound email drive `base_import_pdf_by_template` through the EDI framework's exchange-record pipeline instead of only a manually-uploaded PDF — for as many different senders and target document types as you configure, not just one:

1. Two `extraction_mode` options on `base.import.pdf.template` — `plaintext` and `html` — alongside the `pypdf` mode that ships with `base_import_pdf_by_template`. A template using either mode is matched and processed exactly like a PDF-based one; only the first step (turning the source file into text) is different.
2. A `mail.alias` entry point onto `edi.exchange.record` (from `edi_core_oca`), so an inbound email creates a tracked, retryable EDI exchange record instead of a bespoke `mail.thread` hook.
3. A generic EDI input processor (`edi.input.process.template`) that turns an exchange record into an Odoo record using whichever `base.import.pdf.template` its exchange type points at. Add a new `edi.exchange.type` + `base.import.pdf.template` pair for every new sender/document combination; no new code.

## Why

`base_import_pdf_by_template`'s regex-based field/table matching (`_get_field_header_values`, `_get_table_info`) already works on a plain text string — `pypdf` is only there to get from a PDF binary to that string. Some sources never produce a PDF at all. NAPA Prolink order confirmation emails, for example, only exist as an email body (plain text and HTML alternative parts) — no PDF attachment. This module lets a template be built directly against that text, without inventing a separate import pipeline per document model.

The module is deliberately generic: it only adds extraction modes to the existing framework. It doesn't know about email, purchase orders, or any other specific model — any module that materializes a plain text or HTML body as an `ir.attachment` (mimetype `text/plain` or `text/html`) can hand it to `wizard.base.import.pdf.upload` and get the same auto-detect + template-line processing that PDF attachments get today.

## What it adds

-   `extraction_mode = "plaintext"`: reads the source bytes back as UTF-8 text, no transformation.
-   `extraction_mode = "html"`: same, then runs it through Odoo's `html2plaintext` to strip markup before the template's patterns see it.

Both live in `wizards/wizard_base_import_pdf_mixin.py`, following the same `_pdf_text_extraction_<mode>` naming the base module uses for `pypdf`, so `simple_pdf_text_extraction()`'s dynamic dispatch and `_parse_pdf_grouped()`'s try-every-mode auto-detection keep working unmodified.

This module also depends on `base_import_pdf_by_template_engine` (see that module's README), even though nothing here calls the seams it adds - a `plaintext`/`html` template's lines are always plain regex against flat text, matched exactly like a `pypdf` template's. The dependency exists so the engine's two `_get_table_info_data()` bug fixes (an `IndexError` when no "lines" child line has a pattern yet, and a "lines" column with fewer matches than its siblings silently shifting every later column of that row instead of leaving a blank cell) always apply here too. That second bug is not theoretical for this module: a NAPA order confirmation has a repeating item table (see `tests/data/napa_order_confirmation.txt`), and any "lines" template built against it - or a future sender with similar structure - would hit exactly that path the moment one item's column doesn't match as many times as another's.

## Routing email into an exchange record

`edi.exchange.record` already inherits `mail.thread` (from `edi_core_oca`), so a `mail.alias` can point directly at it — `models/edi_exchange_record.py` overrides `message_new()` to make that alias useful: it stores the raw message body as the exchange's `exchange_file` and hands off to `edi.backend.create_record()`, which resolves the right `edi.exchange.type` and (per that type's `quick_exec` setting) can trigger processing immediately.

The alias only needs two defaults, resolved via its `alias_defaults`:

-   `backend_id` — which EDI backend the message belongs to.
-   `type_code` — which `edi.exchange.type.code` to file it under.

Both are required; a message routed here without them raises rather than creating a record `type_id` can't actually be set on. The body is kept as raw HTML (no conversion at intake) — interpreting it is the extraction template's job, using the `html` mode added above.

The record is created with `edi_exchange_state = "input_received"` straight away: the whole document already arrived in the email, so there is no separate "receive" round-trip to wait for. Skipping this would leave a `quick_exec` type stuck at `"new"` forever — the receive/process cron domains only look for `"input_pending"` and `"input_received"` respectively (see `edi_backend._input_pending_records_domain`/`_input_pending_process_records_domain`), and plain `create()` on `edi.exchange.record` does not infer this transition on its own.

## Processing an exchange record generically

`models/edi_input_process_template.py` adds `edi.input.process.template`, an `edi.oca.handler.process` implementation that:

1. Reads `exchange_record.type_id.import_template_id` (a new field this module adds to `edi.exchange.type`).
2. Extracts text via that template's own `extraction_mode` (reusing `simple_pdf_text_extraction()` — the same dispatch the PDF wizard uses).
3. Runs the template's field/table matching and creates the record with the same `Form()`-based engine `wizard.base.import.pdf.upload` uses for a manual upload.
4. Links the result back to the exchange record via `_set_related_record()`.

To use it for a new sender or document type: build a `base.import.pdf.template` for that model as usual, create an `edi.exchange.type` with **Processor** set to "EDI Input Process: Import by Template" and **Import Template** set to that template, and point a `mail.alias` (or any other trigger) at it with the matching `backend_id`/`type_code`. Nothing here is written against NAPA, purchase orders, or any other specific document — that's the point: the same processor model serves every exchange type configured this way.

A document whose creation needs more than the template engine gives you out of the box — fuzzy partner/product matching, safe updates to an existing record instead of always creating new, dedup — should get its own dedicated processor (e.g. one built on `purchase_order_import`) registered as that exchange type's Processor instead of this generic one. Both kinds of processor can coexist across different exchange types on the same backend.

### `alias_defaults` isn't a per-field form

`backend_id` and `type_code` above are not fields you'll find on `edi.exchange.record` (`backend_id` happens to also be a real column, but that's incidental) - they're just keys in the `mail.alias`'s `alias_defaults` **text** field, which Odoo core only validates with `ast.literal_eval` (no check against real model fields). Set it directly as a Python dict literal, e.g. `{'backend_id': 3, 'type_code': 'napa_prolink_po_confirmation'}` - our `message_new()` override is the only thing that ever reads `type_code`.

### `quick_exec` is hidden for input types in the stock view

`edi_core_oca`'s form only shows `quick_exec` when `exchange_file_auto_generate` is set, and that field is itself only shown for `direction = "output"` - so on an input exchange type `quick_exec` is permanently hidden in the stock view, even though `_quick_exec_enabled()` never checks `exchange_file_auto_generate` for inputs at all. `views/edi_exchange_type_views.xml` overrides that field's `invisible` condition so it shows for inputs too, without touching `edi_core_oca` itself.

## Reference fixture

`tests/data/napa_order_confirmation.txt` is the plain-text body of a real NAPA Prolink order confirmation (Order # NPPLK-00005FVKRE), and `napa_order_confirmation.html` is a trimmed-down HTML document reproducing the same structure. Both are used only to prove the extraction methods round-trip real-world content correctly; this module does not itself define a template or know what a NAPA order looks like — that belongs in whatever module actually imports NAPA confirmations.
